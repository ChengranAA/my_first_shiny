From the direct comparison of mean, each day's positive and death cases in 2021 are higher than in 2020. The pandemic is still progressing. The total number of infected and death is still increasing every day, even after excluding the initial state of spreading. Most of the countries are impacted by the virus. A former statistical method (t-test) could be used to test whether these two mean significantly different from each other. We should take great caution of the COVID-19 situation. Controlling the spreading of the virus is still the priority.
